    "description": "<0>This Trusted Setup is a multi-party ceremony designed to generate a secure SRS (structured reference string) to be used in the proto-danksharding protocol. OK, let's slow down and talk about those terms in more detail.</0><1>Proto-danksharding (aka EIP-4844) is a planned change to the Ethereum protocol which allows transaction data from rollups (Layer 2s) to be succinctly represented on the Layer 1 (mainnet). The benefits are lower transaction fees on the L2, greater scalability and more accessibility to more people!</1><2>The Trusted Setup is a preparatory step required for certain cryptographic schemes such as the KZG polynomial commitment scheme to be used in proto-danksharding. In our case, the trust assumption is that one contributor needs to successfully conceal their secret for the result to be secure.</2><3>It's a multi-party ceremony: Contributors each create a secret and run a computation to mix it with previous contributions and generate a result that can be made public and passed to the next contributor. We need to guard against attempts to control the ceremony, so you'll need an Ethereum or GitHub account with an established history.</3>",

To combat this, this site has been audited and there are alternative implementations of the contribution software built on entirely different software stacks.</p><p>This is why there will be thousands of participants using different pieces of software on different operating systems to help prevent single points of failure both in the people and hardware/software.</p>",

Each SRS has a secret associated with it. For security, the SRS’s must be computed in such a way that no single person knows the secret associated with them. The solution is to have multiple people contribute to the secret. If all of these people collude, then they can recover the secret. If even one person does not collude, then the secret is unrecoverable. The process of multiple people contributing to the secret is known as a ceremony.</3>",
