          The Ethereum community is scaling to global accessibility through{' '}

            Layer-2s (L2s)
          </ExternalLink>
          . L2s increase the total block space available to users while still
          maintaining the security offered by the Ethereum Layer 1 (L1).
        </p>
        <p>
          L2s need to publish a lot of data on Ethereum, and the network
          currently charges high fees for doing so. To fix this, Ethereum will
          create a new data layer, often referred to as <em>sharding</em>. This
          provides what is called &quot;data availability&quot; guarantees to L2
          users. The L1 only holds the data for a limited time, which means we
          can scale the chain without sacrificing decentralization for smaller
          L1 node operators.
        </p>
        <p>
          The current leading design for this is called Danksharding. The
          rollout for this will happen in several steps, with the first one

        <ol>

          <li>
            The output from that computation is passed to Participant 2, where
            they repeat Step 1 with their own secret input (e.g. 3) and mix it
            with the output from the 1st Participant (eg. 5x3=15).
          </li>
          <li>
            This repeats until there is a sufficient number of participants, at
            which point the last output in the sequence becomes the final
            output.

          Ceremonies have also been called &quot;Trusted Setups,&quot; most
          famously used by Zcash to bootstrap their privacy features. However,

          (Proto)-Danksharding requires a commitment scheme for the underlying
          data that is fast to prove and verify (including inside SNARKS for
          SNARK-based L2s) while having a small commitment size. The polynomial
          commitment scheme that best meets the criteria is KZG commitments.
        </p>
        <p>
          The KZG scheme commits to a polynomial by evaluating it at a secret
          value (specifically, a elliptic curve point). The point of this
          ceremony is to construct this secret value in a way that no single
          person knows what this secret is and to do so in a way where many
          people are convinced that no-one knows it even in many years time.

        <p>
          The name &quot;Powers of Tau&quot; comes from the cryptography
          literature on trusted setups and SRSs.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Tau&quot; comes from the Greek letter &#964; which is the
          short-hand for the &quot;secret&quot; referred to in this
          documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          &quot;Powers&quot; refers to the fact that we need not only the
          secret, but also the consecutive powers of the secret. (ie. [1,
          &#964;, &#964;<sup>2</sup>, &#964;<sup>3</sup>,..., &#964;

          </sup>

        </p>
        <p>
          It is worth noting that the Powers of Tau are not raw numbers, but
          they are encoded as elliptic curve points which &quot;encrypts&quot;

          The ceremony has a &quot;1-of-N&quot; trust assumption, which means
          that only a single participant in the entire ceremony needs to have
          not revealed their secret input for everything to be secure.
        </p>
        <p>
          This means that every participant would have to strip apart the
          software that they are using to contribute, get that software to give
          them the secret, and then collude with every single other participant
          to reconstruct the final secret.
        </p>
        <p>
          A more realistic failure mode is a common bug which leaks the
          randomness. To combat this, this site has been audited and there are
          alternative implementations of the contribution software built on
          entirely different software stacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is why there will be thousands of participants using different
          pieces of software on different operating systems to help prevent
          single points of failure both in the people and hardware/software.
